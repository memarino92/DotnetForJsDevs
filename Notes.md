# .NET for JavaScript Developers

Modern .NET is lean, fast, and more like JS than you‚Äôd probably first think. We‚Äôll hit the history, the culture, and the strengths that make .NET worth adding to your stack. From APIs to Blazor to console apps, you‚Äôll walk away ready to ship (and probably more hirable too). Come join us as we answer the burning question on everybody's mind: "Is C# good actually?"

## Misc

This whole repo should be clonable to follow along - this is the talk. One big markdown file and a dotnet solution file that you can spin up and start playing with right from the get-go.

## Outline

- Why .NET?
  - Jobs
    - Supply vs Demand
    - People are always hiring for C#. So what? They're always hiring for JS too. Even though the demand for dotnet may be smaller than that for JS, the community of developers is smaller too (although smallER is relative). The ratio of qualified devs for a given position favors .NET imo.
  - Performance
    - C# (and .NET in general) compares favorably to interpreted languages like JavaScript and Python. JS will nev er be able to keep up to true multi-threaded languages like C# (and Rust, Go, etc) for tasks that benefit from parallelization. Even in single-threaded use cases C# will generally perform better by nature of the benefits that compilation provides.
  - Just trying new things out
    - Learning new languages can only make you a better developer. Learning different approaches and methodologies can unlock better understanding of fundamental concepts of programming and computer science, even if you never seek to be employed with them.
  - Maybe the most controversial of all: C# is good actually
    - C# is a strongly typed language with outstanding tooling and a mature ecosystem that you can be very productive in very quickly. It's has been a breeding ground for new ideas (async/await? using?) and consistently releases updates adding new features to the language and sdks (more on that later).
- What _is_ .NET?
  - .NET runtime in general
    - .NET is the "runtime", but also it's the "ecosystem". .NET CLR is the virtual machine that translates the compiled code to machine code.
  - Different languages (C#, F#, VB)
    - As long as it compiles to IL, different languages can be used in the same project
    - C# - Object oriented, staticaly typed, general purpose. C-like syntax
    - F# - Functional-first, statically typed (Hindley-Millner) general purpose lang.
    - VB - I hope you don't have to write VB ü•≤
  - .NET Framework vs .NET Core vs .NET
    - .NET Framework came first. Windows-only, closed source
    - .NET Core initial release 2015. Open source, cross-platform. Dropped "Core" starting with .NET 5, now it's just ".NET"
      - LTS vs STS
        - New version released every year, .NET 10 releases Nov 2025
        - LTS even-numbered versions. Support for 3 years - every 2 years you have 1 year to upgrade.
        - STS odd-numbered versions. Support for 2 years, every 1 year you have 1 year to upgrade.
  - Unity uses C# language and the Mono runtime - based on Framework, but cross-platform. Bundles runtime when building, unless using IL2CPP, which translates the compiled IL into C++ code, and then compiles the resulting c++.
  - but in general, when people say .NET, they mean C# (just like people say JS but assume you know TS (for example I will use them almost interchangeably throughout), and F# people wouldn't pass up an opportunity to say they write F#)(how can you tell somebody's a functional programmer? Don't worry, they'll tell you.)
  - open source language, open source compiler. not all open source tooling, and some people are mad about it.
- How does it work?
  - Compiled to cpu-agnostic IL
  - IL JIT compiled to machine-specific instructions at runtime by CLR
  - Can publish single file executable w/ packaged runtime
  - AoT introduced in .NET 6
    - remember jamstack and serverless everything? show Microsoft graph from AoT doc page on resource comparison
- Language stuff
  - Anders Hejlsberg designed C#, and TS, and TurboPascal, and Delphi
  - Syntax C-like, so should be familiar to JS devs
  - Things that basically look the same in both languages
    - declaring variables
    - dot syntax to access members
    - explicit typing
    - lambdas
    - spread operator and overwriting properties (vs a with b for c# records)
  - Don Syme designed F#
    - From ML family of languages, can look a bit alien if you're used to C-like syntax - no curly braces, no commas.
      - ‚ÄúOptimising your notation to not confuse people in the first 10 minutes of seeing it but to hinder readability ever after is a really bad mistake.‚Äù (David MacIver, via a post about Scala syntax).
  - Nominally typed vs algebraic types, C#/TS/F#
  - Imports in TS vs using namespaces in C#
  - Other ways to use `using` (scope block, statement)
  - TS namespaces bad, C# namespaces good
  - TS enums bad, C# enums good (and `using static`)
  - Things C# has/can do that TS can't and vice versa (yes and F# too)
- Let's go already
  - Hello World
    - .NET 10 `dotnet run app.cs` without `.csproj`
  - Before .NET 10, (officially) you need a project file (XML version of `package.json`)
  - dotnet CLI
    - `dotnet new` and `dotnet new list`
  - First cultural difference: Sln vs monorepo
  - Sln is standard for containing multiple projects, where projects can reference and depend on each other (very common)
  - Monorepos relatively new thing in TS land comparatively
  - In addition to references to other projects, project files contain packages from a registry (Nuget vs npm)
  - Create slns and projects from templates, link projects together, add packages, restore packages, build, run, watch (hot reload), publish, run tests are things I do daily using cli
  - Visual Studio vs VS Code vs Others
    - Visual studio has most polished experience
      - I hate it
      - Not intuitive - different key bindings than most other programs, windows don't behave as you would expect, run your program? windows start shuffling around, hides files from you?!?! Whyyy would I need to explicitly add files if they are in the directory
      - Too much "magic"
    - VS Code catching up
      - C# Dev Kit extension big step up
      - get familiar with dotnet cli
    - Rider (JetBrains)
      - Smaller, devoted userbase (like most JetBrains products)
- Web development
  - ASP.NET SDK, brief history (it's been around a long time)
  - Controllers in repsonse to Ruby on Rails and that stuck around a long time. MVC pattern very popular.
  - Minimal APIs
    - manual route registration, no reflection based controller setup. Perfect for AoT
    - less "magic", easier to learn, faster to get up and running
    - Link blog on organizing Minimal Apis
  - Configuration loading for multiple environments built in
    - secrets manager for Dev
  - Service Container and dependancy injection
    - Singleton, Scoped and Transient
    - Constructor injection
    - Can use this same system with `ApplicationBuilder` in a console app
  - Logging with ILogger<T>
    - Scoped logging
    - Structured logging
  - Blazor
    - Microsoft's answer to Component driven UIs
    - .`razor` and `.cshtml` templating syntax been around for a while now in MVC, but a `PartialView` is not the same as a named, reusable and composable Component.
    - Two modes of interactivity, as well as purely server-rendered.
    - Web Assembly
      - A SPA that ships what you can think of as two web assembly bundles to the browser - the .NET runtime itself and you app to run on top of it. Thin JS layer to do DOM manipulation.
    - Interactive Server
      - Opens Websocket connection to client. Degrades gracefully to server-sent events and long polling where the server will just hang onto the request until it either times out or has something to send back. JS responsible for passing events back over the wire, and applying DOM updates that come in from the server
      - Application runs in-memory on the server. Hard navigtions or refresh break the Websocket connection and all ephemeral state is lost.
    - Tailwind works great (duh). Can put build command in project file. Watch from tailwind cli plays great with hot reload from dotnet watch.
- Other .NET stuff out there
  - .NET.ML
  - Orleans virtual actor model (powers Halo backend)
  - .NET MAUI, run blazor in mobile apps

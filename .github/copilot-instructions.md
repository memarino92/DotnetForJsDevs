# Copilot Instructions

This repository contains code samples for a talk on .NET development aimed at JavaScript and Typescript developers.  
Examples are organized in named subdirectories under `Examples/`, such as `Examples/HelloWorld`, which contain both `app.cs` and `app.js` files with "Hello World" examples in C# and JavaScript.

## Guidelines

- Examples may be complete programs or simple code snippets.
- Code samples are intended to illustrate concepts, such as type construction or language features.
- Each example directory should include both C# and JavaScript files when relevant.
- Copilot suggestions should focus on concise, illustrative code that supports the talk's topics.

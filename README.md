# DotnetForJsDevs

This repository contains code samples for my talk on .NET development aimed at JavaScript and TypeScript developers.

## Structure

- Examples are organized in subdirectories under `Examples/`, such as `Examples/HelloWorld`.
- Each example directory typically includes both C# (`app.cs`) and JavaScript (`app.js`) files.
- Samples illustrate concepts like type construction, language features, and interoperability.

## Usage

Browse the `Examples/` folders for concise code snippets and illustrative samples to support .NET learning for JS/TS developers.
